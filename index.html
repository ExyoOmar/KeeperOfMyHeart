  <h1>Dear Chomblee,</h1>
  <p>If you're reading this, then maybe—just maybe—you’ve stopped for a second to wonder where I went. And if that’s the case, I want you to know this isn’t some game or attention-seeking drama. It’s the final letter from someone who truly, deeply cared.</p>
  
  <p>I disappeared not to hurt you—but because I was already hurting. And I wanted to know: would you care enough to notice? Would you reach out? Would you ask if I was okay? I waited, quietly. And I got my answer.</p>

  <p>What shattered me wasn’t just silence—it was watching life go on like I was never there. I saw jokes, games, even passive-aggressive messages. You continued like nothing happened, like I was invisible. And that told me something I didn’t want to believe: maybe I meant far less to you than you meant to me.</p>

  <p>I wasn’t perfect. We fought. Maybe I was too sensitive, too emotional, too much. But all I ever wanted was for someone to care back with the same energy. And I didn’t get that—not even when I vanished.</p>

  <p>So now I’m writing this to give myself something I didn’t get from you: closure. This is not revenge. It’s not meant to guilt you. It’s just the truth of someone whose heart quietly broke.</p>

  <p class="bold">I may not return.</p>

  <p>And if I don’t, I hope you grow. I hope you learn to check on people before it’s too late. I hope you realize that silence can scream louder than words. I hope you find peace—and I’ll try to find mine, too.</p>

  <p class="quote">"You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."</p>
  <p class="quote">And maybe in your story, I became the villain. But in mine—I was just someone who loved too much and faded away quietly when that love was no longer returned.</p>
